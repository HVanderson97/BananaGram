# Notes for the Omeka Install
## This was a difficult assignment.

First:
Create a new user and a new database in MySQL for the Omeka installation
(do not re-use the WordPress database, user, or credentials).

I installed the new user and database with MySQL
sudo su
mysql -u root
create user 'omekauser'@'localhost' identified by 'b0ok31299';
create database omeka;
grant all privileges on omeka.* to 'omekauser'@'localhost';
((Had a typo here that I found after much troubleshooting. I added ".db" after omeka and it didn't read the code to grant privleges.))
\q

Next, I installed Zip using:
sudo apt-get install zip
Then changed directory:
cd /var/www/html
Then used wget from the server to download Omeka Classic 
as a Zip file and extracted it in /var/www/html:
https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/releases/download/v3.1/omeka-3.1.zip
Unzipped the file.
(Forgot to login as root user and it was denied. Realized my error rather quickly and
tried again as root, which worked!)
The extracted directory was be named omeka-3.1.
Changed name by using sudo mv omeka-3.1 omeka
Success!


Changed directory by using cd omeka
opened the db.ini file using sudo nano db.ini
and added database credentials, 
'omekauser'@'localhost' identified by 'xxxxxx';
and replaced all values containing XXXXXX, with the appropriate information.


Use the chown command like we did with WordPress on the files directory
in the omeka directory. The user and owner should again be www-data.

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data *

Restart Apache2 and MySQL using:
sudo systemctl restart apache2
systemctl status apache2

In your web browser, go to http://your-ip-address/omeka/ and 
complete the setup via the web form, just like you did with WordPress.


Had an error message on the web browser. Spent 15 minutes troubleshooting and realized I
added an erroneous DB to the granting privleges code line. Re-entered mysql and re-entered
the privleges line. Immediate success when reloading the browser window!
