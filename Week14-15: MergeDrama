Couldn't remember my Wordpress login information, like a dunce. When trying to find it, I accidentally reset the Wordpress blog page.
I tried to create a new user and password, but acciedentally changed the database user in mySQL.  Ended up creating an error in code when changing the user to my username instead of wordpress

To figure out my username, I used the following from WordPress site documenting how to change a password in MySQL.
show databases;
use wordpress;
show tables;
SELECT * FROM wp_users;
SELECT ID, user_login, user_pass FROM wp_users;
UPDATE (name-of-table-you-found) SET user_pass=”(MD5-string-you-made)” WHERE ID = (id#-of-account-you-are-reseting-password-for);” (actually changes the password)
UPDATE wp_users SET user_pass='b0oks31299' WHERE ID = 1;

Before deleting it entirely and starting over, I tried to use a random password I haven't used this entire semester, and that worked! Problem solving for nothing.


Finally completed the Merge in Wordpress pretty easily.
