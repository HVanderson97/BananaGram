Wordpress Install

Updated systems successfully

Made it through steps 1-3 without issue and followed the instructions easily.

Step 4, actually writing the data always makes me nervous in case I have a typo. I have begun to write
out the text in notepad then copy and paste it over to ensure no errors exist.

Took a bit to find the end to add the FS_Method information, but entered sucessfully.

Changed the name of Wordpress directory to Blog using
cd /var/www/html
sudo mv wordpress blog

Finally completed steps 6-7 without issue!

I am familiar with Wordpress through a personal blog, so the interface is familiar for once
and not as intimidating!
