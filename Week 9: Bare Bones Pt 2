Creating Bare Bones OPAC Pt 2

1. Created the form by following the text instructions instead of the video
and paused after creating the HTML form.

2. I have a ton of files that were accidentally saved; I tried to delete
but getting an error message. Will investigate later.

3. After working with HTML and Java in 636, reading the code is much easier.

4. Add code to Insert.php with no issues. Yay!

5. Tried the pages with the web browser and the new record was created successfully.

6. Added the password prompt without issues!

7. All works when running in the browser.

Happy to report this week was straightforward and I feel accomplished.

**Note, tried to upload to Git and ended up creating an additional Repos instead of file. I attempted to troubleshooting to delete it, but I am terrified I will
end up deleting all my files, so I will save this task for after this assignment is graded!
